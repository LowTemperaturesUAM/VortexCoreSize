# VortexCoreSize
Calculation of the vortex core size the model proposed in A. Fente et al. Phys. Rev. B 94, 014517 (2016). 
The model provides an analytic expression for N(r) based on deGennes' relationship between DOS and the order parameter that reproduces well scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).
